# Wolf-DNS-Update-Client
Simple DDNS Client I made to work with the domains.google.com API.
Configurable settings when launched for the first time.
After that it will load from the config.xml file in the root directory of the application.
If you want to reconfigure then delete that file and run again. Updates the DNS record with the public IP of current machine its running on by checking checkip.amazonaws.com.

Free to use and modify at will. This code is provided as is for use in any setting without guaranteed support from me.
Feel free to make suggestions though and I will look at them when I have time.
